        <p>With so many awesome board games coming out each year, it can be tough to know which games you're going to love. We give curated recommendations for games you should try, based on a game you already enjoy playing.

        <h2>About Our Team</h2>
        <p>We are 3 friends who love playing games and working on side projects together. Video games and board games have been a huge part of our lives, and we have always wanted to make games of our own one day. To make that happen, we founded Spiralburst Studio in 2019, and you can check out all of our projects below!</p>
