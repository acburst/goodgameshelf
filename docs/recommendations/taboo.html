        <p>Taboo is a classic word game that is fun for any big group. The game might be simple, but the time pressure and word limitations make it a real challenge.<br><br>If you're looking for a new team-based competition all about guessing secret words, these 3 games are similar to Taboo and add some fun new rules.</p>

        <p>Time's Up! is another game where two teams race to guess the most words before time runs out. This game is played over 3 rounds, and the rules for giving clues become progressively more strict. This gives more variety in gameplay compared to Taboo, where the rules stay the same.<br><br>In the Round 1, the clue giver is allowed to say <strong>anything they want</strong> besides the secret word - there are no off-limits words like in Taboo. In Round 2 however, clues can only be a single word! And in Round 3, you can't speak at all and must act out the word like charades.<br><br>Here's the catch though - the same 30 cards will be used for all 3 rounds. This means that both teams will hear every secret word after the first round, and you can rely on your memory when you're working with 1-word and charades clues.<br><br>Time's Up! will test your memory on top of the quick thinking required in Taboo. If you want a game that is just as easy to learn but offers a fresh take on the rules, give this game a shot!<br><br>Quick note - we think the "Title Recall" version is easier for more people to have fun with:<br><br><a class="text-link" href="https://amzn.to/31Vb5Zd">Buy Time's Up! on Amazon</a></p>

        <p>Codenames has become a popular game since its release in 2015, and for very good reason. This game blends word association, deductive reasoning, and high-stakes strategy, all into a game that is easy and fun to play. If you like Taboo but want a new challenge, you'll love Codenames - it lives up to the hype! <br><br>25 word cards are laid out in a grid on the table. Another card shows a pattern of blue and red squares which correspond to the grid, but only one player from each team will see this information - the Spymasters. As Spymaster, you give clues to your team about the words that match your color, and it's a race to get your team to identify all of your words first!<br><br>Here's the tricky part though - clues must be only one word and one number. If you give the clue "Sandwich, 2," this would mean 2 words on the board are related to "sandwich." Your team then tries to guess which words you are thinking of - maybe "cheese" and "bread." However, it is entirely possible that your team accidentally guesses a word for the opposing team!<br><br>Codenames requires deep strategic thinking, but any group can quickly pick it up and start playing. If you think you and your friends can mind-meld for the win, Codenames is the best in its class.<br><br><a class="text-link" href="https://amzn.to/3gWlAlg">Buy Codenames on Amazon</a></p>

        <p>Banned Words is similar to Taboo, but instead of each card showing the words that are off-limits, the other team gets to decide! <br><br>Each round, one team draws a card showing 5 secret words that their opponents will be guessing. They collectively write down 10 "banned words" they think their opponents will use as clues, and hand the card to the clue-giver on the opposing team.<br><br>The clue-giver provides clues to the 5 words like in Taboo - if a word is correctly guessed, the guesser's team earns 1 point. If the clue-giver OR the guessers say a banned word though, the opposing team gets a point! Banned Words really is a mind-game at its core. It goes something like this:<br><br><span class="quote"><strong>Secret Words:</strong> Flute, Tree, Raccoon, Brain, Pot<br><strong style="color:red;">Kolby:</strong> "I'm putting trash and panda for Raccoon"<br><strong style="color:red;">Levi:</strong> "What the heck, that's not a thing."<br><strong style="color:red;">Kolby:</strong> "Just wait."<br><strong style="color:blue;">Steven:</strong> "Okay, so this is a living creature, some people call it a trash panda..."<br><strong style="color:red;">Kolby:</strong> "TRASHPANDAAA! WE'LL TAKE THOSE POINTS, LET'S GOOO!"</span><br><br>If you love Taboo but would prefer more teamwork and ridiculousness, Banned Words will give you exactly that. This game will keep everyone entertained and is perfect for a tight-knit group.<br><br><a class="text-link" href="https://amzn.to/3iL0eYK">Buy Banned Words on Amazon</a></p>
