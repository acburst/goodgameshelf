          <p>
            Coup is your game if you enjoy tricking your friends or you are just generally sneaky. Players are assigned two secret roles, each with a special ability. You may claim to be *any* role on your turn to use the ability you want, but another player can challenge you. If they call your bluff, you lose a life. And if they're wrong, it's their loss!
            <br><br>

            One of the best parts about Coup is that you don't always have to bluff in order to succeed. The strategy and tricks you use can also be entirely different between games, which will let you keep playing Coup without getting bored.
