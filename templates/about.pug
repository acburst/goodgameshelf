          h1 About Good Game Shelf
          p
            | So many amazing board games are released every year, but it's tough to know which ones #[em you] will actually like. We're trying to make that easier by recommending a few games based on one you already enjoy.
            br
            br
            | We mostly recommend games with similar mechanics and a similar "feel" to the game you know. However, we also recommend fun games that aren't as closely related to expose you to a wider variety.
            br
            br
            | We hope you find our curated recommendations helpful, and please #[a.text-link(href="https://forms.gle/HAWRTytXp4CV1nob8") let us know] if we can improve anything!

          h2.category-header About Us
          | We're 3 friends who love playing games and working on projects together. We play regularly with our #[a.text-link(href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjrwJy6p2SWqyIDXvavEoug") awesome board game group], and they've helped expose us to a ton of modern games. We've also seen how much research they put into deciding on which games to buy, which inspired us to make Good Game Shelf.

              .bio Felicia designed the Good Game Shelf site and writes some of our articles. She once placed 3rd in a Can't Stop tournament at a board game convention, and less prestigiously won 1st for OrlÃ©ans in another ðŸ¤“. Her favorite game is #[a.text-link(href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars") Terraforming Mars].

                | Alan implemented the site's functionality and structure. You probably can't beat him at SSBM, Starcraft, or Chess, but Castles of Mad King Ludwig, no problem. He loves deck builders and his favorite is #[a.text-link(href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium") Dune: Imperium].

              .bio Christian writes most of Good Game Shelf's articles and upkeeps the site on occasion. He somehow has an 85% winrate in Quacks of Quedlinberg and swears there is a strategy (it's blue chips). His favorite game is #[a.text-link(href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root") Root] and likes the lizards and crows the best.
